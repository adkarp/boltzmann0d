# Overview
Final project for ECE 6030 at the George Washington University.

0D solver for the Boltzmann equation using the relaxation time approximation:
$$
\begin{equation*}
    \boxed{\frac{qE}{m^*}\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}=\frac{f_0-f}{\tau_c}}
\end{equation*}
$$
with $f_0$ being the ideal equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 

Solvers using deterministic Runge-Kutta 4th Order and Monte-Carlo solver.
